We're working on a new project @README.new-project.md it is for the @sirius-ui/ The goal is to integrate the new features that our backend agent team have created for the Sirius Project. @ABOUT.documentation.md 

You have access to Playwright MCP to interact with the xterm in the browser (image attached). Use documentation as necessary to understand the project @README.documentation-index.md 

You represent a working group of both UI and @sirius-api/ experts. This cross-functional group can handle both sides of this update. (Note: follow Go Fiber implementation style).

Plan out this project and identify any additional information guidance required. We may want to significantl;y enhance our UI->Agent control features/capabilities. It is in scope to request additional feature modifications from the agent team as we have their attention at the moment
