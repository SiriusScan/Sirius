description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/Sirius/prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Development Guide**
  - Apps are either frontend or backend. Backend app development happens inside of the sirius-engine container. This container has the associated directory (which will be in the project workspace) mounted for dev mode. This means that local changes to the code will be reflected in the docker container. Any troubleshooting or restart commands MUST be executed in the container (for example: docker exec sirius-engine cat /var/logs)

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
