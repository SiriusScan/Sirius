# SiriusScan

SiriusScan is an open-source security engineering platform for teams that want continuous visibility, faster risk triage, and practical remediation workflows.

We build security tooling for real operators and developers: discover assets, identify vulnerabilities, prioritize what matters, and integrate security work into day-to-day delivery.

## What We Build

- Continuous discovery and scanning across hosts, services, and infrastructure
- Vulnerability intelligence and risk prioritization using actionable severity context
- Operational workflows for remediation tracking and security posture reporting
- API-first and automation-friendly components for modern DevSecOps pipelines
