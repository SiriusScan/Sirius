**User**: @FX42S  
**Error**: `reading ../go-api/go.mod: open /repos/go-api/go.mod: no such file or directory`

## Issues Requiring Follow-Up

### 1. Issue #74 - RabbitMQ Endless Reboot ⚠️ REQUIRES USER ACTION

**Reported**: October 10, 2025 (day before v0.4.0 release)  
**User**: @easy13 (Oracle Linux Server 9.6)  
**Error**: RabbitMQ container constantly restarting

**Analysis**:

- User is trying multiple non-existent compose files:
  - `docker-compose.prod.yaml` ❌ (doesn't exist)
  - `docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.prod.yaml` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- User environment shows older image version (likely pre-0.4.0)

**Root Cause**: Using outdated instructions/compose files

**Action Required**:

1. Inform user about v0.4.0 release
2. Provide correct deployment instructions:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
3. Explain new 2-mode deployment structure
4. Request user to test and report results

**Keep Open**: Until user confirms resolution or provides additional details

## Response Templates

### For Build Order Issues (#73, #71, #69)

````markdown
Hi @[username],

Thank you for reporting this issue! This has been resolved in **v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

**The Problem**: The build order in the Dockerfile was incorrect - `app-scanner` was being built before `go-api` was available, causing the "no such file or directory" error.

**The Fix**: We've corrected the build order in the `sirius-engine/Dockerfile`. The `go-api` repository is now cloned and built first (as the comment indicated it should be!), then `app-scanner` can successfully build with the required dependencies.

**To Update**:

```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```
````

This issue is now closed as resolved. If you continue to experience problems after updating, please feel free to reopen or create a new issue.

**Reference**: See CHANGELOG.md - "Go Module Dependencies: Resolved version conflicts between sirius-api, go-api, and app-scanner modules"

### For RabbitMQ Issues (#55, #54)

```markdown
Hi @[username],

Thank you for reporting this RabbitMQ connectivity issue! We've made significant improvements in **v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025) that should resolve this problem.

**The Fix**: We've corrected RabbitMQ health check patterns and improved connection reliability across all services.

**To Update**:
```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
````

**Please Test**: After updating, please verify that the issue is resolved. If you continue to experience RabbitMQ connectivity problems, please reopen this issue or create a new one with:

- Output of `docker compose ps`
- Logs from RabbitMQ: `docker compose logs sirius-rabbitmq`
- Any relevant error messages

We're closing this as likely resolved, but we're here to help if you need further assistance!

**Reference**: See CHANGELOG.md - "RabbitMQ Connectivity: Corrected health check patterns for reliable service monitoring"

### For Deployment Structure Issue (#58)

```markdown
Hi @ashvile-queen,

Thank you for reporting this! The issue with `docker-compose.production.yaml` has been resolved in **v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

**What Changed**: We've simplified the deployment structure from 3 modes to 2 modes for better reliability and maintainability:

**New Deployment Options**:
1. **Standard Mode** (recommended for production):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
````

2. **Development Mode** (for contributors with hot-reloading):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
   ```

**Migration Instructions**:

```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

The default `docker-compose.yaml` is now production-ready with optimized configurations. The old `docker-compose.production.yaml` file no longer exists.

This issue is now closed as resolved. If you have any questions about the new deployment structure, please let us know!

### For Issue #74 (User Action Required)

```markdown
Hi @easy13,

Thank you for the detailed report! I see you're experiencing RabbitMQ restart issues on Oracle Linux Server 9.6.

**Important Update**: Sirius Scan **v0.4.0** was just released (October 11, 2025) with significant improvements to RabbitMQ connectivity and container builds.

**Issue with Your Commands**: The compose files you're trying to use don't exist:
- ❌ `docker-compose.prod.yaml` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `docker-compose.production.yaml` - removed in v0.4.0

**Correct Deployment for v0.4.0**:
```bash
# Update to latest version
cd Sirius
git pull origin main

# Clean up old containers
docker compose down -v

# Start with correct compose file
docker compose up -d --build
````

**New Deployment Structure**:

- `docker-compose.yaml` - Standard/Production mode (what you should use)
- `docker-compose.dev.yaml` - Development mode (only for contributors)

**RabbitMQ Improvements in v0.4.0**:

- Corrected health check patterns
- Improved connection reliability
- Better error handling

**Please Try This** and let us know if the RabbitMQ restarting issue persists. If you continue to have problems, please provide:

1. Output of `docker compose ps` (after update)
