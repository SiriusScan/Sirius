## Issue #73 - @FX42S - Arch Linux Build Error

````markdown
Hi @FX42S,

Thank you for reporting this issue! This has been **resolved in v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

### The Problem

The build order in the Dockerfile was incorrect - `app-scanner` was being built before `go-api` was available, causing the "no such file or directory" error you encountered.

### The Fix

We've corrected the build order in `sirius-engine/Dockerfile`. The `go-api` repository is now cloned first, then `app-scanner` can successfully build with the required dependencies.

### To Update

```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```
````

This should resolve your build issue on Arch Linux. The fix applies to all platforms.

**Reference**: See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) - "Go Module Dependencies: Resolved version conflicts between sirius-api, go-api, and app-scanner modules"

Closing this as resolved. If you continue to experience problems after updating, please feel free to reopen or create a new issue. Thanks again for the report!

## Issue #71 - @wpf973 - Error

```markdown
Hi @wpf973,

Thank you for reporting this! This build error has been **resolved in v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

### The Issue
This is the same Go module dependency issue that was affecting multiple users (see #73, #69). The build was trying to access `go-api` before it was cloned.

### The Fix
We've corrected the build order in the Docker configuration to ensure dependencies are built in the correct sequence.

### To Update
```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
````

**Reference**: This issue is documented in our [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) under "Go Module Dependencies: Resolved version conflicts between sirius-api, go-api, and app-scanner modules"

Closing as resolved. Please let us know if you need any assistance!

## Issue #69 - @nicpenning - Build Fails Due to Missing Files

```markdown
Hi @nicpenning,

Excellent detective work! You correctly identified both the problem AND the solution. Thank you for the detailed report and fix suggestion!

### Resolution
Your fix has been **implemented in v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025). The `go-api` repository is now cloned before `app-scanner`, exactly as you recommended (and as the comment indicated it should be!).

### What We Fixed
```dockerfile
# Clone go-api first (needed by other components) ‚Üê Comment was right!
RUN git clone https://github.com/SiriusScan/go-api.git && \
    cd go-api && \
    git checkout ${GO_API_COMMIT_SHA} && \
    go mod tidy

# Clone app-scanner ‚Üê Now happens AFTER go-api
RUN git clone https://github.com/SiriusScan/app-scanner.git && \
    cd app-scanner && \
    git checkout ${APP_SCANNER_COMMIT_SHA} && \
    go mod download && \
    CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o scanner main.go
````

### To Get the Fix

```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

You should now be able to build successfully without any manual Dockerfile modifications!

**Reference**: See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) - "Go Module Dependencies: Resolved version conflicts between sirius-api, go-api, and app-scanner modules"

Thank you again for the excellent bug report and solution. Contributions like yours help make Sirius better for everyone! üéâ

Closing as resolved.

## Issue #58 - @ashvile-queen - Production Setup Error

```markdown
Hi @ashvile-queen,

Thank you for reporting this! The issue with `docker-compose.production.yaml` has been **resolved in v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

### What Changed
We've simplified and improved the deployment structure. The `docker-compose.production.yaml` file that was causing validation errors has been removed and replaced with a streamlined 2-mode deployment system.

### New Deployment Structure

**Option 1: Standard Mode** (Recommended - production-ready)
```bash
docker compose up -d
````

This uses `docker-compose.yaml` which is now optimized for production deployments.

**Option 2: Development Mode** (For contributors with hot-reloading)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

### Migration Instructions

```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

The default `docker-compose.yaml` is now production-ready with:

- ‚úÖ Optimized container builds
- ‚úÖ Proper security configurations
- ‚úÖ All services correctly configured
- ‚úÖ No validation errors

**Reference**: For more details, see our updated [README.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/README.md) or [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Closing this as resolved. If you have any questions about the new deployment structure, please let us know!

## Issue #55 - @JM2K69 - sirius-rabbitmq Reboot Looping

```markdown
Hi @JM2K69,

Thank you for reporting this RabbitMQ issue! We've made significant improvements in **v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025) that should resolve this problem.

### What We Fixed
- ‚úÖ Corrected RabbitMQ health check patterns
- ‚úÖ Improved connection reliability
- ‚úÖ Better error handling for RabbitMQ connectivity
- ‚úÖ Enhanced service initialization sequences

### To Update and Test
```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down -v  # Note: -v removes volumes for clean start
docker compose up -d --build
````

### After Update

Please check if the issue is resolved:

```bash
docker compose ps
# sirius-rabbitmq should show "Up" status, not "Restarting"
```

**Reference**: See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) - "RabbitMQ Connectivity: Corrected health check patterns for reliable service monitoring"

### If Issue Persists

If you still experience RabbitMQ restarting after this update, please reopen this issue with:

- Output of `docker compose ps`
- RabbitMQ logs: `docker compose logs sirius-rabbitmq`
- System information (which you already helpfully provided!)

We're closing this as likely resolved based on our RabbitMQ improvements. Thank you for your patience and for reporting this issue!

## Issue #74 - @easy13 - RabbitMQ Endless Reboot (REQUIRES USER ACTION)

```markdown
Hi @easy13,

Thank you for the detailed report with system information! I have good news - **Sirius Scan v0.4.0** was just released (October 11, 2025) with significant improvements to RabbitMQ connectivity and container builds that should help resolve this issue.

### Important: Incorrect Compose Files
The compose files you're trying to use don't exist in the current version:
- ‚ùå `docker-compose.prod.yaml` - doesn't exist
- ‚ùå `docker-compose.production.yaml` - removed in v0.4.0

This might be why you're experiencing issues - you may be using outdated documentation or an older version of the repository.

### Correct Deployment for v0.4.0

**Step 1: Update to Latest Version**
```bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
````

**Step 2: Clean Up Old Containers**

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

**Step 3: Start with Correct Configuration**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### New Deployment Structure

- ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yaml` - Standard/Production mode **(use this one!)**
- ‚úÖ `docker-compose.dev.yaml` - Development mode (only for contributors)

### What v0.4.0 Fixed for RabbitMQ

- ‚úÖ Corrected health check patterns
- ‚úÖ Improved connection reliability
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ Enhanced service initialization

### After Updating, Please Verify

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# If RabbitMQ is still restarting, get logs
docker compose logs sirius-rabbitmq
```

### If Issue Persists

If you still see RabbitMQ restarting after following these steps, please provide:

1. Confirmation you're on the latest version: `git log -1 --oneline`
2. Output of `docker compose ps`
3. RabbitMQ logs: `docker compose logs sirius-rabbitmq --tail=100`
4. Any error messages from the logs

We're keeping this issue open until you can test the update. Your Oracle Linux 9.6 environment will help us ensure compatibility across different platforms.

**Reference**: See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for all v0.4.0 improvements.

Thank you for your patience, and please let us know how it goes!
