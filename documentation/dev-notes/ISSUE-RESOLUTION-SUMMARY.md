## üöÄ Quick Post Commands

### Post Comment and Close Issue #73

```bash
gh issue comment 73 --body-file <(cat <<'EOF'
Hi @FX42S,

Thank you for reporting this issue! This has been **resolved in v0.4.0** (released October 11, 2025).

### The Problem
The build order in the Dockerfile was incorrect - `app-scanner` was being built before `go-api` was available, causing the "no such file or directory" error you encountered.

### The Fix
We've corrected the build order in `sirius-engine/Dockerfile`. The `go-api` repository is now cloned first, then `app-scanner` can successfully build with the required dependencies.

### To Update
\`\`\`bash
cd Sirius
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
\`\`\`

This should resolve your build issue on Arch Linux. The fix applies to all platforms.

**Reference**: See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) - "Go Module Dependencies: Resolved version conflicts between sirius-api, go-api, and app-scanner modules"

Closing this as resolved. If you continue to experience problems after updating, please feel free to reopen or create a new issue. Thanks again for the report!
