# [System/Component] Architecture

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive architectural documentation for [specific system/component] within the Sirius project. ARCHITECTURE documents serve as authoritative sources for system design, component relationships, data flow, and structural decisions.

## When to Use

- **System Design**: When designing new systems or major components
- **Integration Planning**: When connecting systems or components
- **Code Review**: When reviewing implementation against architectural decisions
- **Onboarding**: When bringing new team members up to speed
- **Refactoring**: When making significant structural changes

## How to Use

### Quick Overview

1. **Start with the System Overview** to understand the big picture
2. **Review the Component Architecture** to understand individual parts
3. **Follow the Data Flow** to understand how information moves
4. **Check the Integration Points** to understand connections
5. **Reference the Design Decisions** for context on why choices were made

### Architecture Patterns
