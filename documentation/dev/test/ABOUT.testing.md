# About Testing in Sirius

## Overview

Testing in Sirius follows an **operator-first philosophy** that prioritizes real-world validation over traditional unit testing. Our testing approach focuses on proving that complete systems, processes, and integrations work correctly in realistic scenarios, rather than testing individual code units in isolation.

## Testing Philosophy

### Operator-First Approach

**Core Principle**: Tests should validate that operators can successfully use the system to accomplish real tasks.

**What This Means**:
- Tests simulate actual user workflows and operations
- Validation focuses on end-to-end functionality
- Tests prove that complete processes work as intended
- Results must be actionable and meaningful to operators

**Example**: Instead of testing a scanner function in isolation, we test that the scanner can be invoked standalone, process real data, and produce valid results that an operator would actually use.

### Integration-Focused Testing

**Primary Goal**: Validate that different components work together correctly.

**Testing Scope**:
- Cross-service communication
- Data flow between components
- End-to-end process validation
- Real-world scenario simulation

**Benefits**:
- Catches integration issues that unit tests miss
- Validates complete workflows
- Ensures system reliability for operators
- Provides confidence in production deployments

## Current Testing Infrastructure

### Container Testing

**Location**: `testing/container-testing/`

**Purpose**: Validate Docker container builds, health, and integration

**What's Tested**:
- Docker Compose configuration validation
- Individual container builds (all targets)
- Service health checks
- Cross-service communication
- Integration testing

**Automation**:
- `make test-all` - Complete test suite
- `make test-build` - Build validation
- `make test-health` - Health checks
- `make test-integration` - Integration testing

### Documentation Testing

**Location**: `testing/documentation/`

**Purpose**: Validate documentation completeness, accuracy, and consistency

**What's Tested**:
- YAML front matter completeness
- Template compliance
- Index completeness
- Link validation
- Metadata validity

**Automation**:
- `make lint-docs` - Full documentation validation
- `make lint-docs-quick` - Quick validation
- `make lint-index` - Index completeness check

### Pre-commit Validation

**Location**: `scripts/git-hooks/`

**Purpose**: Quick validation before commits

**What's Tested**:
- Docker Compose configuration validity
- Basic syntax checks
- Quick documentation validation
- Code formatting

## Testing Standards

### Test Structure

**Standalone Execution**: Every test must be able to run independently without dependencies on the main codebase.

**Real Data**: Tests should use realistic data and scenarios, not mocked or synthetic data.

**Actionable Results**: Test results must provide clear, actionable information for operators and developers.

**Automated Validation**: All tests must be automatable and runnable via command-line tools.

### Test Categories

#### 1. Build Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure components can be built correctly

**Examples**:
- Docker container builds
- Multi-stage build validation
- Architecture compatibility
- Dependency resolution

**Validation Criteria**:
- Build completes without errors
- All build targets work correctly
- Images are properly tagged
- Dependencies are resolved

#### 2. Health Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure services start and remain healthy

**Examples**:
- Service startup validation
- Health endpoint checks
- Resource availability
- Graceful shutdown

**Validation Criteria**:
- Services start within expected time
- Health endpoints respond correctly
- No critical errors in logs
- Proper resource utilization

#### 3. Integration Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure components work together correctly

**Examples**:
- Cross-service communication
- Database connectivity
- Message queue functionality
- API endpoint integration

**Validation Criteria**:
- Services can communicate
- Data flows correctly
- APIs respond as expected
- Error handling works

#### 4. Process Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure complete workflows function correctly

**Examples**:
- End-to-end scanning processes
- Data processing pipelines
- User authentication flows
- Deployment processes

**Validation Criteria**:
- Complete workflows execute successfully
- Results are valid and usable
- Error conditions are handled
- Performance meets requirements

## Future Testing Objectives

### Next 3 Months

**Priority 1**: Scanner Testing Infrastructure
- Standalone scanner execution tests
- Real vulnerability detection validation
- Output format verification
- Performance benchmarking

**Priority 2**: API Testing Infrastructure
- Endpoint functionality validation
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data validation and error handling
- Performance and load testing

**Priority 3**: Engine Testing Infrastructure
- Agent communication testing
- Task execution validation
- Resource management testing
- Error recovery testing

### Long-term Vision

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Every major component and process will have dedicated testing infrastructure.

**Automated Validation**: All tests will be integrated into CI/CD pipelines and pre-commit hooks.

**Operator Confidence**: Tests will provide operators with confidence that the system works correctly in production.

**Continuous Improvement**: Testing infrastructure will evolve with the system to maintain high quality standards.

## Testing Best Practices

### For Test Developers

1. **Start with Real Scenarios**: Design tests around actual operator workflows
2. **Use Real Data**: Test with realistic data, not synthetic or mocked data
3. **Validate Complete Processes**: Test end-to-end functionality, not just individual components
4. **Make Tests Standalone**: Ensure tests can run independently without external dependencies
5. **Provide Clear Results**: Test output should be actionable and meaningful

### For System Developers

1. **Design for Testability**: Build components that can be tested independently
2. **Expose Health Endpoints**: Provide clear health and status indicators
3. **Use Standard Interfaces**: Follow consistent patterns for APIs and data formats
4. **Document Dependencies**: Clearly document what each component needs to function
5. **Plan for Validation**: Consider how operators will validate that components work correctly

### For Operators

1. **Run Tests Regularly**: Use testing infrastructure to validate system health
2. **Understand Test Results**: Learn to interpret test output for troubleshooting
3. **Report Issues**: Use test failures to identify and report problems
4. **Validate Changes**: Run tests after any system changes or updates
5. **Trust the Tests**: Use test results to make operational decisions

## Testing Tools and Commands
