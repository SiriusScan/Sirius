## Database Management

### Default Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

### Resetting the Database

If you've modified the database during testing (e.g., changed the password) and need to reset it to default values:

**Inside the container:**
```bash
docker exec -it sirius-ui npx prisma db push --force-reset
docker exec -it sirius-ui npm run seed
```

**Or from your local machine (if running locally):**
```bash
cd sirius-ui
npx prisma db push --force-reset
npm run seed
```

This will:
1. Reset the database schema
2. Recreate the default admin user with password: `password`

**Note:** Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`) are gitignored to prevent committing test data. Each developer maintains their own local database state.
