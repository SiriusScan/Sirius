# GitHub Issue → Branch → Commit Workflow Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Documentation Updates

Updated `documentation/dev/operations/README.git-operations.md` with:

1. **GitHub Issue Integration Section**

   - When to create issues vs. when to skip them
   - Issue creation process and templates
   - Linking branches to issues with naming conventions
   - Documenting implementation plans in issue comments

2. **Complete GitHub Workflow Section**

   - Full 11-step workflow from issue to cleanup
   - Workflow decision matrix for different scenarios
   - Simplified workflow for small changes
   - Fast-track workflow for emergency fixes

3. **Enhanced Commit Message Standards**

   - How to reference issues in commits
   - Closing keywords that auto-close issues
   - Detailed examples with issue references
   - Multi-line commit message format

4. **Updated Common Scenarios**
   - Complex bug fix with GitHub issue (full workflow)
   - New feature development with GitHub issue
   - Emergency hotfix with retroactive issue
   - Simple fixes without issues

### ✅ Created GitHub Issue Content

File: `tmp/GITHUB_ISSUE_CONTENT.md`

Complete issue ready to post on GitHub with:

- Problem statement
- Current behavior (detailed analysis)
- Expected behavior
- Root cause analysis
- Complete implementation plan with checkboxes
- Testing strategy with verification commands
- Affected components list
- Priority justification

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue ⏳

1. Go to https://github.com/SiriusScan/Sirius/issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Title: **Fix: system-monitor and app-administrator startup failures in production and development modes**
4. Copy content from `tmp/GITHUB_ISSUE_CONTENT.md` into issue description
5. Add labels: `bug`, `priority:high`, `docker`, `production`
6. Submit issue
7. Note the issue number (e.g., #123)

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
# From main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create branch with issue number (replace 123 with actual number)
git checkout -b fix/123-service-startup-failures
```

### Step 3: Execute Implementation Plan

Following the detailed plan from our earlier diagnosis:

**Phase 1: Production Mode Fixes**

- Fix `sirius-api/Dockerfile` (6 changes)
- Fix `sirius-engine/Dockerfile` (5 changes)
- Fix `sirius-ui/Dockerfile` (1 change)

**Phase 2: Development Mode Fixes**

- Fix `sirius-api/Dockerfile` CMD
- Fix `sirius-engine/start-enhanced.sh`
- Fix `sirius-ui/start-dev.sh`

**Phase 3: Testing**

- Test production mode builds and startup
- Test development mode builds and startup
- Verify process monitoring
- Check logs

**Phase 4: Commit and Merge**

- Commit with detailed message referencing issue
- Push branch to GitHub
- Merge to main
- Verify deployment
- Close issue with results

### Step 4: Commit Format

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve system-monitor and app-administrator startup failures

Production Mode Changes:
- Updated sirius-api Dockerfile to fix binary paths and add administrator
- Updated sirius-engine Dockerfile to build and copy administrator
- Updated sirius-ui Dockerfile to build and copy administrator
- Fixed all binary paths to be consistent across containers

Development Mode Changes:
- Updated sirius-api CMD to start administrator with go run
- Updated sirius-engine start-enhanced.sh to detect and run source code
- Updated sirius-ui start-dev.sh to start administrator with go run

Testing:
- Verified production mode starts both services in all containers
- Verified development mode starts both services in all containers
- Confirmed process monitoring works correctly
- Validated logs show successful startup

Affected Components:
- sirius-api/Dockerfile
- sirius-engine/Dockerfile
- sirius-engine/start-enhanced.sh
- sirius-ui/Dockerfile
- sirius-ui/start-dev.sh

Closes #123"
```

### Step 5: Merge and Deploy

```bash
# Push feature branch
git push origin fix/123-service-startup-failures

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge fix/123-service-startup-failures

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Cleanup branch
git branch -d fix/123-service-startup-failures
git push origin --delete fix/123-service-startup-failures
```

### Step 6: Close Issue

The issue should auto-close when the commit with `Closes #123` is merged to main.

If it doesn't auto-close:

1. Go to the issue on GitHub
2. Add a comment with test results
3. Manually close the issue

## Workflow Benefits

### Process Improvements

1. **Better Tracking**: All significant work is tracked in GitHub issues
2. **Clear Documentation**: Implementation plans are documented before work begins
3. **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can see what's being worked on
4. **Historical Record**: Issues provide context for why changes were made
5. **Automatic Linking**: Commits automatically reference and close issues

### Documentation Benefits

1. **Consistent Process**: Everyone follows the same workflow
2. **Clear Examples**: Real scenarios with commands to copy-paste
3. **Decision Matrix**: Know when to create issues vs. direct commits
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track workflow for critical fixes
